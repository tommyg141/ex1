# this project make wight graph 
the graph incloud 
node`s and edge`s
each node have uniqe key that save for him the tag 
and the Neighbors list
each edge will set by there own wight 
the shortst path between nodes Determined by there wight of edge




use serveal methods for making the graph

1) dijkstra
 an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph
by the wight of the edge`s
2)bfs
 an algorithm for finding if all the graph is connected
